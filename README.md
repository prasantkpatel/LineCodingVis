# LineCodingVis
I've done a small piece of work on generating the time-domain digital signal for various line coding techniques.
These Include the three major techniques, viz, Unipolar, Polar and Bipolar. I am still left to include MLT3 and various
scrabling techniques which exist, to make it more versatile. I will keep updating it as I progress.
